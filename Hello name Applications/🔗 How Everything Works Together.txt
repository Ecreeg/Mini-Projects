ðŸ”— How Everything Works Together:

HTML provides the content and structure.

CSS makes it visually appealing.

JavaScript adds interactivity, allowing users to change part of the page by clicking a button.

All together, they build a tiny interactive app where the user can make the page say hello to them personally.
